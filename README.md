The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Represents the UI components.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the state and logic for the views.

## Branching Strategy
We follow a structured branching strategy to ensure a smooth development workflow:
- `main`: Contains the stable production code.
- `feature/<issue-number>/description`: For developing new features.
- `bugfix/<issue-number>/description`: For fixing bugs.

3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push your branch to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request describing your changes.

## Design System
